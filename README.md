# 🤖 Machine Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng) – My Hands-On Notes & Labs

This repository contains my **hands-on implementations, notes, and mini-projects** from Andrew Ng's **Machine Learning Specialization**(Coursera).  
The goal is to document **my understanding in practice** — with clean notebooks, extra experiments, and reflections.

> ⚖️ **Academic Integrity:** I do **not** publish graded solutions or proprietary course material. Code and notes here are my **own implementations** and **extra explorations** on public/allowed datasets.
